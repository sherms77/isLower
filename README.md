# isLower
This is an exercise from How to think like a computer scientist - 1st edition.
The exercise appears in Section 7.10 - Pg.80.
exercise_cs pg.80.txt file has details about the exercise.
There are 3 files with 3 different versions of the isLower function. 
The files are: isLower1, isLower2 and isLower3.
I created a script to test the run times of each file.
isLower.timeTests.py shows the run times of each isLower script.
isLower_runtimes folder contains the log files.
Added a fourth file: isLower_a. Contributed by Angie H.
Updated test file with Angie's script.
