How to think like a cs

Section 7.10 - Pg.80
Exercise: As an exercise, discuss which version of isLower you think will be fastest.
Can you think of other reasons besides speed to prefer one or the other?
code: https://repl.it/@ShermanBernard/isLower#main.py
Python files: isLower1.py, isLower2.py and isLower3.py

I think the third version of the isLower function will be the fastest. 
This is because it doesn't traverse the entire string. Instead, it checks if ch is within the range. This seems to be a faster process. 

Additionally, the third version appears to not have any dependicies. The first version uses the find function and the second version uses the ascii method. 

The other advantages of this version is that it requires less code and its easier to read.

Notes(Pg.80 exercise): 
I was having trouble understanding what the author was trying to achieve but I think I understand it now.

The output for the first version of the isLower function is: 
in ['c']: print isLower('c') # Python 2 code
out ['c']: True

The book did not specify what the correct output should be, so I was confused about what the function was trying to do.

I understand now that the function outputs True or False based on whether the result -1. If its not -1, its True. 
The purpose is the same for the second and third versions of the function but the in operator and range function is used instead.
